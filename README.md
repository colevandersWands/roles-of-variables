learning objectives
* granular analysis of variable usage
* variables are not functionally the same, they can be used in different roles
* a variable's profile includes: where is it declared, assigned, read, modified, what type
* the profile can be determined just by reading the code, and can be used to determine the role
* after learning the roles, you can use variables more effectively and with fewer bugs

exercise: 
* given a snippet of code 
* create a profile for each variable 
* determine each variable's role
* and study how they all interact
